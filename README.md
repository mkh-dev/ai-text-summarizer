![course thumbmail](public/images/learning.png)

## Pre-requisite resources
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces)
- [The Postman AI Text Summarizer course](https://academy.postman.com/project-ai-text-summarizer)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Project-Based Learning module focused on building an AI-powered text summarizer web app! Throughout this module, we'll walk you through the process of creating a robust text summarization application using Node.js, Replit or GitHub Codespaces, the Hugging Face Inference API, and Postman. You'll not only explore real-world APIs but also generate code and customize your app with newfound skills.

By the end of this module, you'll be adept at using Postman to seamlessly incorporate APIs into your applications.

## Skills Development

Skills you'll be using and developing:
- Build and deploy a full-stack app on Replit/ GitHub Codespaces using HTML/CSS/JavaScript and Node.js
- Explore real-world APIs with Postman, including the Hugging Face Inference API for text summarization with AI
- Use Postman to generate code and integrate APIs into an application
